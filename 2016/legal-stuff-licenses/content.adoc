== Who should care about licenses?

*Everyone who writes software!*


== Raise the code to github does not make it Open Source.

In copyright laws, the abscense of license means *ALL COPYRIGHT*

In other words: *Propietary software*.


== Aspects of Licenses

- *copyleft* and *non-copyleft*
- compatibilty with other types of free licenses
- compatibility with proprietary licenses
- enforncement of credit
- protection of trademark
- patents.


== But what means *copyleft*?

[quote,http://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html]
____
Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.
____


== Strong copyleft

(also called stiky or transitive).

_Examples: GPL, AGPL_

- If you use _GPL_ library in your code, your code should be gpl also.
- If you modify _GPL_ source, you should release the modified source also under _GPL_.


== Weak copyleft

_Examples: EPL, CDDL, LGPL, MPL_

- You can use the EPL library in your code without the obligation of release your code under EPL.
- If you modofy EPL source you should release the modified source also under EPL.


== Non-Copyleft licenses

_Examples: MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, ISC_

Also named: *permissive licenses*

- Without obligation to share source of the modification.
- Compatibility with proprietary licenses.
- More simple legal text.


== Differencies & Compatibilities


_One license (A) is compatible with other (B) when the second (B) has the same (or more) clauses that the first (A)_.


== Example: MIT and GPL

> *MIT is compatible with GPL* because its clauses has the equivalent in GPL.

> If you are developing an application using GPL license, you can incorporate code under MIT in your code, but not in backward direction.
> The final code will be GPL (because it is more restrictive).


== Example: Apache 2.0 and GPL

> _GPLv3_ includes a patents clause (will be explained later) in the equvalent way as _Apache 2.0_. +
> *Apache 2.0 is compatible with _GPLv3_*.

> _GPLv2_ does not includes the patent clause, the clauses mismatch causes that *_Apache 2.0_ is incompatible with _GPLv2_*.


== Example: GPLv2 and GPLv3

> _GPLv2_ is compatible with _GPLv3_ only if it includes a special emphasis:

[quote]
____
[...] you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [...], either version 3 of the License, *or (at your option) any later version*.
____

> Without that *emphasis*, GPLv2 is incompatible with GPLv3. Clear example: Linux kernel.


== Compatibility with proprietary licensing

> The permissive (non-copyleft) free licenses allow the covered code to be used in proprietary programs.

> A big subset of *permissive* licenses explicitly allows *sublicensing*.


== The "sublicensing" term

> Is the permission that gives you the right to distribute derivative works under equvalent or more restrictuve
> license. The more restrictive license should be at least restrictive as original.

> *It does not allow arbitrary licence changes.*


== The "patent" license.

> Is a special clause that explicitly gives you a patent license.


== Tour: MIT

Type of license: *permissive*

- include copyright.
- include license.
- you can do anything else.

*Almost identical/equivalent to BSD (2-Clause)*


== Tour: BSD

_I'm reffering to 3-Clauses version_

Type of license: *permissive*

*The same as _MIT_ with additional clause for protect trademark.*


== Tour: Apache 2.0

Type of license: *permissive*

*Very in line with _MIT_ and _BSD_ but with additional clauses and more explicit:*

- Additional explicit clause for *sublicense*.
- Additional explicit clause for *warranty*.
- Patent license.

*Is a very popular license used by companies to publish their software under
_permissive_ type of license.*


== Tour: MPL

Type of license: *weak copyleft*

*In addition to _MIT_ or _BSD_:*

- trademark protection clause
- disclose the source.
- the ability to license binaries with different license.
- the ability to *mix* with other licenses (explanation needed).


== Tour GPLv3


Type of license: *strong copyleft*

*In addition to _MIT_ or _BSD_:*

- no sublicense clause.
- trademark protection clause.
- disclose the source.
- strong definition of derivative work (stiky).
- explicit clause for to be combined under AGPLv3.
- install instructions.
- explicit state of any relevant changes to software done by third party.


== Proprietary relicensing

*Two commonly known modes*:

- Dual license (opensource and proprietary).
- Open Core (core opensource, plugins proprietary).


== Dual license

*Main purpose:*

> _Selling exceptions to copyleft requirements._ Is typically used with code libraries rather than with standalone applications.

> The author of library (i.e., copyright holder) distributes its library under _GPL_ or any other strong copyleft license but
> sells that library under more permisive licenses to companies that want include/use that library in proprietary software.

*PyQt is the most common example of that.*


== Open Core (or Freemium)

> Distributes the core under open source license (usually permisive or require strong CLA) and the additions/plugins under
> proprietary license.

- Usually wrongly named "Community version" and "Enterprise version".
- Usually the open source part has strong CLA and does not has real code contributions.


== Contribution License Agreements

*There are three ways to handle copyright ownership: _do nothig_, CLA, or CA (copyright assignment)*

== CLA & CA: _Do Nothing_

Some projects never collect CLAs or CAs from their contributors. Instead, they accept code whenever it seems reasonably
clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated into the project.

*Implications:*

> Someone may eventually decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging that they are the true owner of the code in question
> and that they never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open source license.

> *Today* is *not recommeded*.


== CLA & CA: _CLA_ (Contributor License Agreement)

Is a explicit document that the contributor should accept (with an simple email, web form or just message in the Pull-Request).

It does *not transfer copyright ownership* and does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Example:

> Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to _[...]_. and to recipients of software distributed by _[...]_. a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, *sublicense*, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.


== CLA & CA: _CA_ (Copyright Assignment)

An explicit document usually hand signed that the contributor should sign and send via standard mailing or
via specialized software for digital signing with the purpose of *transfer the copyright*.

Implications:

- a lot of friction for contribution process
- almost not used or adapted to be more CLA friendly:

Example:

> [...] You hereby grant to JetBrains and to recipients of software distributed by JetBrains a perpetual, worldwide,
> non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, [...] sublicense, and publicly perform
> and display the Contribution and such derivative works on any licensing terms, *including without limitation open source
> licenses and binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses*.


== CLA & CA: DCO (Developer's Certificate of Origin)

I a simpler style _CLA_ with less friction for contributors.

Implies:

- Show properly the user the contribution policy.
- Sign with a simple excplicit message on the commits (`git commit -s`).

```git
Fix issue #000.

Signed-off-by: Andrey Antukh <niwi@niwi.nz>
```

*Used by openstack, linux kernel, docker, and is widelly accepted in the open source
community and backed up by FSF*.


== Personal considerations/recommendations

- If you are releasing a library, just use a *permissive* license.
- Set up a good contribution policy. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` of popular open source
  projects (Gitlab has great one).
- If you release a big application, consider use a some kind of CLA or DCO.
- Do not use GPL licensed libraries on your work at least it is clearly and
  explicitly allowed.
