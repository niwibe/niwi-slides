== About that is this talk?

A little and mostly practical introduction to functional programming in the jvm.


== Immutability


Ideas:

- Trust the code.
- Predictability
- Something that you are doing with test and is it is integrated in the language.
- Simplicity about reasoing functions that always do one concrete thing.
- Mutability is an optimization, not an design pattern.
- Implies better and predictable design, if you can not mute thins, you star designing a small
  pieces that transform data. That implies improved testability.

Cons:

- Evident overhead of copying


== Persistent data structures

- Efficient way to handle immutable data
- Mostly efficient as standard data structures.
- Can be converted efficiently in mutable data structures in case of optimization.


== Responsability separation.


- Objects stores data (not behavior).
- Functions encapsulates behavior.
- classes stores abstractions.


Pros:

- Improves code modularity and extensibility (see next slides)
- Changes how you reason about your code.
- Clear separation of things, data is not mixed with behavior.
- Datastructures are for store data, and solve this problem well.
- Functions are for transform data structures.
- Classes are for define an abstraction (commonly called typeclasses in haskell).

Cons:

- Mostly imposible in languages where functions are not first-class.
- Clojure, haskell...


== Abstractions (part 1)

- Tend to build on abstractions (also best practice in OOP).
- Abstractions are extensible in all directions.
- FP tends implement good abstraction for work with sequences.


== Sequences (part 1)

- Forget loops with side effects.
- Reduce or recursivity is your friend when you need accumulate or reduce some collection.
- Define transformations as side effect free functions and apply it to the collection.
- This approach improves reusability (the reduce function can be reused in other contexts).
- Lazyness, evaluate only that you really need.


== Sequences (part 2)

Facts:

- You are constantly defines transformations over concrete abstractions.
- The transformations are always coupled to secuences.

Notes:

- Would be awesome have a way to compose transformations independently of data structure.
- Would be awesome use that computations in abstractions different that sequences like
  streams, channels, observables, promises, ...
- Clojure has a solution: transducers.
- In same things as languages like java or scala or other oop langs in the jvm, when the datatype
  is mixed the behavior, the behavior never can be separated and reused as easy how it can be done
  in clojure or haskell.


== Error handling

- No more exceptions as flow control.
- Design by contract.
- Error as value.
- Error treatment defined in the type (no ad-hoc error handling).


Cons:

- Language should help in this aspect.

//^ NOTES: in java you should use optional with explicit and ad-hoc handling. scala helps with the for-loop, haskell and clojure helps a lot in make really syntactic abstraction over all abstractions.


== Polymorphism & Abstractions

- Not only exists polymorphism by type (type matching).
- Not only exists polymorphism by generic type (generics).
- The real modularity and extensibility is a unfullfiled promise on OOP.
- Languages like raket and clojure offers a full support for all types of polymorphism.

Notes:

- The oop languages does not allows implement abstractions for existing types because the behavior
  and data is mixed... we should "open" the object definition (class) and add more implementation
  and this is only posible with your types.
- Is much better define own abstractions and work in terms of them independently of the data types
  you are using, but if you could not extend third party data type with other abstraction you should
  think in other hacky solutions.

The expression problem.


== State

- Add more predictability and serializability.
- Having this approach you always should reproduce a concrete behavior.
- It is not about 100% purity, is about limit the side effects to the exterms of your application.
- Lear how define your application in reemplaceables modules.
- Work on abstractiosn help to this task.
- Isolate the persistence and state to the last part of your aplication.
- We should have side effects, because in case contrary we only can contribute to the global warming ;)
