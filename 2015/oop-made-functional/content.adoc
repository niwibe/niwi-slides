== About that is this talk?

About powerful but molstly hidden features of clojure.


== Expression problem: introduction.

*The Expression Problem is a new name for an old problem.*

The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype
and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while
retaining static type safety (e.g., no casts).


== Expression problem: concrete example (1)

We are developing a xmpp client using third party xmpp client library for connect to xmpp server.
In xmpp has different entities, but we will use two: *RosterItem* and *Jid*.

- Roster in xmpp terminology is a *"address book"*, and *RosterItem* is an entry in that address book.
- Jid is a simply user identity, and you can found them on "from" and "to" properties on received message instances.
- Both, *RosterItem* and *Jid* in our hipotetical case represents a User, but they have different semantics and some different properties.


== Expression problem: concrete example (2)

The library that we are using defines that hipotetical clases for represent *RosterItem* and *Jid*:

.Hipotetical data type (class) of RosterItem
[source, groovy]
----
public class RosterItem {
  public String name // "niwi"
  public String domain // "niwi.be"
  public SubscriptionType subscriptionType
}
----

.Hipotetical data type (class) of Jid
[source, groovy]
----
public class RosterItem {
  public String local // "niwi"
  public String domain // "niwi.be"
  public String resource // "mypc"
}
----

== Expression problem: concrete example (3)

- We need treat that data types like a User data type in almost all out code base.
- We need a common abstraction for access in a "polymorphyc way" to properties.
- We can not change the source code, because is a third party library.


== Expression problem: potential solutions (1)

*Inheritance from a common superclass*

The traditional object-oriented solution to problems of this sort is to leverage subtype polymorphism â€” that is, inheritance.

In my example, both *RosterItem* and *Jid* need should return a *bare* and *full* representation.
For it, ideally, both classes would implement some interface with the necessary methods:

[source, groovy]
----
public interface IUser {
  public String getName()
  public String getBare()
  public String getFull()
}
----

*But it is not an option because we need modify the source code of third party library.*

== Expression problem: potential solutions (2)

*Multiple inheritance*

Another approach to the Expression Problem is multiple inheritance, in which one subclass can extend many superclasses.

.Pseudocode
[source, groovy]
----
public User extends RosterItem, Jid implements IUser {
  public String getName() { /* implementation */ }
  public String getBare() { /* implementation */ }
  public String getFull() { /* implementation */ }
}
----

But:

- it leads to complex and sometimes unpredictable class hierarchies.
- it is not very common feature on languages.
- it is not possible in all cases.


== Expression problem: potential solutions (3)

Another popular solution is to write *wrappers* around classes whose behavior you want to modify.

[source, groovy]
----
public class MyRosterItem implements IUser {
  final private RosterItem rosterItem
  public MyRosterItem(final RosterItem rosterItem) { this.rosterItem = rosterItem }
  public String getName() { /* implementation */ }
  public String getBare() { /* implementation */ }
  public String getFull() { /* implementation */ }
}
----

- it breaks identity: MyRosterItem instance is not RosterItem instance, you can not pass MyRosterItem
  instance to method that expects RosterItem.
- you can't compare MyRosterItem and RosterItem with `==` operator and expect return true.
- you can't use `Object.equals` because it should be symetric.
- wrappers classes add additional complexity and are tedious to write: what is happens if
  RosterItem implements List interface or any other with huge number of methods, your wrapper
  should implement them also.

== Expression problem: potential solutions (4)

*Open Clases or Runtime Traits*

The Ruby and JavaScript languages have helped to popularize the idea of open classes in object-oriented programming.

- An open class isn't limited to the set of methods that were implemented when it was defined.
- Anyone can "reopen" the class at any time to add new methods, or even replace existing methods.

So, RosterItem and Jid can be reopen and extended with new methods. But:

- it is forbidden/not supported on most programming languages.
- breaks namespacing (like any other solution exposed previously)
- name clashing: you have no way of knowing that some other user of that class won't define a different,
  incompatible method with same name.
- also known as "Monkey Patching"


== Expression problem: potential solutions (4)

*Conditionals*

One of the most common solutions to the "Expression problem": create a different class with static methods and
use conditionals.

[source, groovy]
----
public class Utils {
  public static String getName(final Object data) {
    if (source instanceof RosterItem) { /* implementation */ }
    else if (source instanceof Jid) { /* implementation */ }
    else { throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid source."); }
  }
}
----

- we are not working on abstractions: we are not really extending the type, we are creting
  a function that works on concrete types.
- can grow into not maintenable code.
- not performs very well.


== Expression problem: potential solutions (5)

*Overloads*

One of the most common solutions to the "Expression problem": create a different class with static methods and
use overloads.

[source, groovy]
----
public class Utils {
  public static String getName(final RosterItem data) { /* implementation */ }
  public static String getName(final Jid data) { /* implementation */ }
}
----

- performs better that conditionals.
- becomes unpredictable in the face of inheritance hierarchies.
- we are not working on abstractions: we are not really extending the type, we are creting
  a function that works on concrete types.


== Expression problem: the clojure approach (1)

Clojure is designed and written in terms of abstractions. And the *protocols* and *datatypes* provides a
powerful and flexible mechanisms for abstraction and data structure definition with no compromises vs
the facilities of the host platform.

There are several motivations for protocols and datatypes:

- clear separation between behavior and data.
- protocols provide high-performance dynamic polymorphism construct as an alternative to interfaces.
- protocols provide the good of interfaces.
- Avoid the 'expression problem' by allowing independent extension of the set of types, protocols,
  and implementations of protocols on types, by different parties.


== Expression problem: the clojure approach (2)

.Define our protocol
[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.users.protocols)

(defprotocol IUser
  "Common abstraction for access to user like objects."
  (get-name [_] "Get user name.")
  (get-bare [_] "Get bare representation of user")
  (get-full [_] "Get full representation of user"))
----

- No implementations are provided.
- Docs can be specified for the protocol and the functions.
- The above yields a set of polymorphic functions and a protocol object.
- All are namespace-qualified by the namespace enclosing the definition.
- The resulting functions dispatch on the type of their first argument, and thus must have at least one argument.
- `defprotocol` is dynamic, and does not require AOT compilation.


== Expression problem: the clojure approach (3)

.Add implementation to our types for this protocol.
[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.types
  (:require [myapp.users.protocols :as impl])
  (:import somelib.roster.RosterItem
           somelib.jid.Jid))

(extend-protocol impl/IUser
  RosterItem
  (get-name [o] (.-name o))
  (get-bare [o] (str (.-name o) "@" (.-domain o)))
  (get-full [o] (str (.-name o) "@" (.-domain o)))

  Jid
  (get-name [o] (.-local o))
  (get-bare [o] (str (.-local o) "@" (.-domain o)))
  (get-full [o] (str (.-local o) "@" (.-domain o) "/" (.-resource o))))
----

- extend-protocol extend own or third party clases or clojure datatypes without modifying them.


== Expression problem: the clojure approach (3)

.Usage example
[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [myapp.users.protocols :as impl])
  (:import somelib.roster.RosterItem
           somelib.jid.Jid))

(let [jid (Jid. "niwi" "niwi.be" "mypc")
      ritem (RosterItem. "niwi2" "niwi.be" :both)]
  (println "Result: " (impl/get-bare jid))
  (println "Result: " (impl/get-bare ritem)))

;; Will print on stdout:
;; "Result: niwi@niwi.be"
;; "Result: niwi2@niwi.be"
----

- Protocols exposes namespaced functions.
- No risk of name clashing, you can have different protocols with overlaped or
  identical method names.
- In future we can add more types (own or third party) to play well with IUser abstraction.
- Covers 80%-90% of use cases of multimethods (see below).


== Polymorphism: introduction

Is the provisioning of a single interface to entities of different types.

A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.

There are several fundamentally different kinds of polymorphism:

- If a function denotes different and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on a limited
  range of individually specified types and combinations, it is called *ad hoc polymorphism*. +
  _Ad hoc polymorphism is supported in many languages using *function overloading*._
- If the code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any
  number of new types, it is called parametric polymorphism. +
  _In the object-oriented programming community, this is often known as *generics* or *generic programming*.
  In the functional programming community, this is often simply called *polymorphism*._
- Subtyping (or *inclusion polymorphism*) is a concept wherein a name may denote instances of many different
  classes as long as they are related by some common superclass or interface. +
  _In object-oriented programming, this is often referred to simply as *polymorphism*._


== Polymorphism: clojure approach (1)

Clojure goes beyond of standard polymorphism: multimethods.

It is commonly called *polymorphism a la carte*.

.Simple polymorphic function example:
[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.impl)

(defmulti get-name class)

(defmethod get-name RosterItem
  [ritem]
  (.-name ritem))

(defmethod get-name Jid
  [jid]
  (.-local jid))
----

== Polymorphism: clojure approach (2)

.Explanation of syntax
[source, clojure]
----
(defmulti get-name class)
;;        ^        ^
;;        |        ` dispatch function
;;        ` name of the method

(defmethod get-name RosterItem
  [ritem]          ;; ^
  (.-name ritem))  ;; ` dispatch mark
----


== Polymorphism: clojure approach (3)

Clojure multimethods:

- Covers standard polymorphism dispatching by type.

But also:

- You can extend and add more cases.
- You can provide own dispatcher function.
- You can dispatch by anything.
- You can build adhoc hierarchies.


== Polymorphism: clojure approach (4)

.Extending with more cases.
[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.extensions.fakeuser
  (:require [myapp.impl :as impl]))

(defrecord FakeUser [name])

(defmethod impl/get-name FakeUser
  [user]
  (:name user))
----


*Now, when you call impl/get-name with fake user instance
it will work as expected, returning a name.*

== Polymorphism: clojure approach (5)

.Own dispatch function
[source, clojure]
----
(defmulti do-stuff (fn [person] [(:firstname data)
                                 (:lastname data)])
(defmethod do-stuff ["Pepe" "Garcia"]
  [person]
  (println "Hello Pepe Garcia")

(defmethod do-stuff ["Pepe" "Lopez"]
  [person]
  (println "Hello Pepe Lopez")
----

== Polymorphism: clojure approach (6)

Build ad-hoc hierarchies

._derive_ is the fundamental relationship-maker
[source, clojure]
----
(derive ::circle ::shape)
(derive ::square ::shape)
----

._parents_, _ancestors_, _descendants_ and _isa?_ let you query the hierarchy
[source, clojure]
----
(parents ::circle)
;; => #{:user/shape}

(ancestors ::square)
;; => #{:user/shape}

(descendants ::shape)
;; => #{:user/circle :user/square}

(isa? ::square ::shape)
;; => true
----

== Polymorphism: clojure approach (7)

Continuation...

[source, clojure]
----
(derive ::triangle ::shape)

(defmulti foo class)
(defmethod foo ::circle [o] :foo-circle)
(defmethod foo ::square [o] :foo-square)
(defmethod foo ::shape [o] :foo-generic-shape)
(defmethod foo :default [o] :unexpected)

(foo ::circle)
;; => :foo-circle

(foo ::triangle)
;; => :foo-generic-shape

(foo ::bar)
;; => :unexpected
