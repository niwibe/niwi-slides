Why?
----

- Because django is the most used and the most powerful web framework on python.
- Because, alternatives sucks (flask) or are not general puropose (tornado).
- Because we can!


This talk is not about django, is about flask.
----------------------------------------------

- Flask has worse design desisions...
- Flask says litle and modular but is fake...
- App abstraction is well and beautiful, but any one need
  mutiple applications in one file?
- ...


Advantages of using django.
---------------------------

- Scales much well, if size of application increases.
- Has much more comunity.
- Better python3 support.
- ...


How we start?: Views
--------------------

Simple django, view. Can be used as is.

[source, python]
----
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World!")
----





Very simple!

[source, python]
----
import sys

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.http import HttpResponse

settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    SECRET_KEY="secret",
    ROOT_URLCONF=sys.modules[__name__],
)

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World!")

urlpatterns = [
    url(r"^$", index, name="index"),
]
